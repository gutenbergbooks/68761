<p><i>The Scene is the living room, dining room and
kitchen—all in one—of Pierrot and Pierrette.
It has the diminutive look of a toy house, and
the immaculate spick-and-spanness. There are
copper kettles and pots on shelves and blue and
white plates and cups and saucers. There is a
crib in the corner, left, with a screen that can
be drawn about it. A table is at the right, front,
by the side of which sits Pierrot, head in hands,
elbows on knees, very gloomy. A door, left,
leads to an inner room; a door, right, to the
street.</i></p>

Pierrot—things aren’t nearly as bad as you

</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span></p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>They didn’t laugh to-day, Pierrette; and they
didn’t laugh yesterday. They haven’t laughed
for a long time—not as they used to. (<i>Most
gloomily</i>) And three of my songs have come
back from the editors!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERRETTE</span> (<i>defending him</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>But who cares for editors, Pierrot? They’re
such stupid creatures! Some day you’ll write
a great song that everybody’ll love; and then
you’ll see all the foolish little editors bringing
you velvets and gold.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span> (<i>in gloom</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>No. The editors are right. The people are
right. Something’s gone out of me. I’m not
the same as I was before—before—How long
have we been married, Pierrette?</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERRETTE</span></p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Just three tiny years!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span> (<i>sighing</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Only three years! (<i>Then bitterly—to Pierrette</i>)
Here!—I’ll give you a sign. Look!</p>

<p>(<i>He walks with flat, listless feet up and down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the room; then speaks, with a hopeless sob in
his voice</i>) I no longer walk on my toes! See!
Flat—like that! No songs ever walked that
way! Songs? No—here’s the way—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>No—I can’t do it. It’s gone out of me. (<i>Desperately</i>)
Pierrette—I’ve come to a conclusion.
I ought never to have married!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERRETTE</span> (<i>suddenly stabbed</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, Pierrot, it’s been the most beautiful thing

</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span></p>

<p>That’s because you’re a woman, Pierrette, and
not an artist.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERRETTE</span></p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>But <i>you</i> said it was the most beautiful thing in
all the world, Pierrot.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span> (<i>vaguely</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Did I? That was long ago. You don’t understand,
Pierrette. Women never do. Life to
them is a little cage in which they sit all day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
long and sing tiny songs about tea and muffins.
Men are different. Put them in a cage
and they sing for a day. Then they begin to
droop.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERRETTE</span> (<i>hurt</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>So you want to go away, Pierrot?</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span> (<i>passionately</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>I want to capture it again—the power, the
thrill, the fire of song!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERRETTE</span></p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>And you would capture it if—if I—(<i>looking

<p><span class="allsmcap">PIERROT</span> (<i>flinging out his arms in despair</i>)</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Oh, I’m a brute, Pierrette! I don’t know. I’m
gone stale—that’s the trouble. I’m done for—all
these worries and things. I’ll sit at home,
I guess, and darn socks!</p>

away when they begin to show wear—now

No siree! (<i>Impressively</i>) You got to mend
’em. And there’s tricks about mendin’ them,

’em so’s they’s worse’n they was in the beginning.

at all. In fact, I’ve mended some of them so
they was better that way than they was in the

I tell you when things are like that, something’s

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Anthology of Dramatic Theory and Criticism from<br />
Aristotle to the Present Day, In a Series of<br />
Selected Texts, With Commentaries,<br />
Biographies and Bibliographies</span></p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">By BARRETT H. CLARK</span></p>

<p class="center">AUTHOR OF</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">“Contemporary French Dramatists,” “The Continental
Drama of Today,” “British and
American Drama of Today,” etc., etc.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A book of paramount importance. This monumental anthology
brings together for the first time the epoch-making theories and criticisms
of the drama which have affected our civilization from the beginnings
in Greece down to the present day. Beginning with Aristotle,
each utterance on the subject has been chosen with reference to its
importance, and its effect on subsequent dramatic writing. The texts
alone would be of great interest and value, but the author, Barrett
H. Clark, has so connected each period by means of inter-chapters
that his comments taken as a whole constitute a veritable history of
dramatic criticism, in which each text bears out his statements.</p>

<p>Nowhere else is so important a body of doctrine on the subject of
the drama to be obtained. It cannot fail to appeal to anyone who is
interested in the theater, and will be indispensable to students.</p>

<p>The introduction to each section of the book is followed by an
exhaustive bibliography; each writer whose work is represented is made
the subject of a brief biography, and the entire volume is rendered
doubly valuable by the index, which is worked out in great detail.</p>

<p><i>Prof. Brander Matthews</i>, of Columbia University, says: “Mr.
Clark deserves high praise for the careful thoroughness with which
he has performed the task he set for himself. He has done well what
was well worth doing. In these five hundred pages he has extracted
the essence of several five-foot shelves. His anthology will be invaluable
to all students of the principles of playmaking; and it ought
to be welcomed by all those whose curiosity has been aroused by the
frequent references of our latter-day theorists of the theater to their
predecessors Aristotle and Horace, Castelvetro and Scaliger, Sidney
and Jonson, d’Aubignac and Boileau, Lessing and Schlegel, Goethe
and Coleridge.”</p>

<p><i>Wm. Lyon Phelps</i>, of Yale University, writes: “Mr. Clark’s book,
‘European Theories of the Drama,’ is an exceedingly valuable work
and ought to be widely useful.”</p>
